# Mindwatch: Keeping tech minds in balance

## ðŸŽ¯ Project idea

In recent years, the tech industry has experienced rapid growth, accompanied by high demands on employees' mental and emotional well-being. The pressures of tight deadlines, long hours, and complex projects often lead to increased stress, anxiety, and burnout among professionals in this field. Despite growing awareness, mental health support in workplaces remains reactive rather than proactive.

To address this gap, we are developing MindWatch, a web-based tool designed to assess and monitor the mental health of employees in the tech industry. Our motivation stems from the need to create a system that not only identifies potential mental health concerns early but also empowers organizations to take informed, proactive measures to support their workforce.

The platform will leverage AI to analyze survey responses, incorporating standardized mental health assessments such as PHQ-9, GAD-7, MBI, and PSQ. It will also integrate data from work-related activities, such as repository changes, project statuses, deadlines, and other performance metrics, to provide a comprehensive picture of an employeeâ€™s well-being.

At the end of this project, we aim to deliver a functional and insightful tool that uses AI-driven insights to help organizations foster healthier, more sustainable working environments for their employees. Our ultimate vision is to contribute to reducing mental health challenges in the tech industry by bridging the gap between awareness and action.
