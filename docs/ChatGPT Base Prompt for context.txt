ChatGPT Base Prompt for context

I am currently doing a Project for my university, where I implement a Web Application. The purpose of the application is a Tool to track the mental health and wellbeing of Tech Employees in big companies. The tool features a Survey and collects data from other sources. It combines all that data and displays it to the User and HR Managers. For each Team we will try to predict how stressed, close to a burnout or other things the employees are, with an AI Model. 

The Application has a backend with ASP.NET Core 8 with RESTful API, I use OpenAPI Swagger. The architecture is onion architecture and I am trying to fulfill the common .NET Core Microservice Principles. My Backend stores its data in a SQL Database, the Communication is done with Entity Framework Core, code-first principle. 

The Applications Frontend is made with Vue js, with Typescript. 

The whole Application is run on Docker, I have 3 docker containers, for the SQL Databse Server 2022, the .NET Core API and the Frontend.
